### Background

As previously discussed, the Coronavirus Pandemic has affected many different facets which will in some way change the outcome of the 2020 Presidential Election. First and foremost, the pandemic makes in-person voting dangerous. As a result, many states have strengthened and expanded mail-in voting. [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/us/elections/vote-by-mail-election.html?auth=login-google) predicts that the 2020 election may end up much like the 2000 election, ending with a Supreme Court case as a result of possible lawsuits cause by the rejection of ballots filled out incorrectly.

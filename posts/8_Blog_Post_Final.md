# Final Prediction

## November 1, 2020

### Background

***This election will be one of the most important in modern history.***

With only 2 more days until the 2020 Presidential Election, both fears and hopes are heightening across America. Will Donald Trump remain in office, or will Joe Biden be able to defeat an incumbent president? In what has been deemed a "Referendum on President Trump" by the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-trump-referendum-11604098637) and others, this election has been framed around Trump as a president, rather than the specific policies. Even with hopes of swaying voters by attacking Donald Trump's [COVID-19 response](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/biden-hammers-trump-on-coronavirus-response-in-final-days-of-campaign/), [furthering of racism](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/us/trump-proud-boys-biden.html), and [denial of the effects of climate change](https://www.npr.org/2020/09/14/912799501/i-don-t-think-science-knows-visiting-fires-trump-denies-climate-change), Biden's main argument is that Donald Trump is simply unfit to be President of the United States. President Trump, on the other hand, has attempted to show voters that he is "Making America Great Again," and he says to vote for Biden would be to elect a corrupt, [life-long politician of 47 years](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-ive-done-more-in-47-months-than-biden-in-47-years-2020-9). 


***Unprecedented times means bad news for our predictions.***

It would be a mistake to claim that this election is like any other in the history of the United States. We are at the crossroads of [multiple crises](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/opinion/us-coronavirus-protests.html): COVID-19, a racial reckoning, and the threat of an impending economic depression. While each of these are certain to shape the outcome of the 2020 Presidential Election, the unprecedented events make predictions this election even more difficult than ever before. With record lows seen across the board in economic variables, many fundamentals-based models are [no longer reliable in 2020](https://www.wsj.com/articles/its-the-economy-stupid-carries-less-weight-in-2020-election-11599989400). Polling, too, has been [called into question](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/10/29/what-we-can-trust-2020-election-polls-to-tell-us/) after the 2016 election, which predicted a near-certain win for Clinton. Even those whose models using the economy have performed well in the past are turning away from such variables in 2020, including Abramowitz, whose Time For Change model predicted a Trump victory in 2016. In 2020, [Abramowitz](https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/its-the-pandemic-stupid-a-simplified-model-for-forecasting-the-2020-presidential-election/) instead opted to use net approval, rather than relying on grossly extrapolated predictions using 2nd Quarter GDP Growth, in order to predict the election. 

***Despite the 2016 polls, we can remain (cautiously) confident in 2020 polls.***

Because of the uncertainty associated with extrapolating fundamentals, I have taken Nate Silver's advice: rely on polling close to the election. [Silver](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-can-still-win-but-the-polls-would-have-to-be-off-by-way-more-than-in-2016/) maintains the belief that polls were not truly *wrong* in 2016, and he says that polls today would have to be even worse than those in 2016 to give Trump a victory. Because of this, I will remain confident in the use of polls in my model.

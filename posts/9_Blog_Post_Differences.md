### How does the 2020 Presidential Election stand out from historical trends?

The 2020 Presidential Election was certainly like no other before; with unprecedented voter turnout, record breaking popular vote totals, and the effects of the Coronavirus Pandemic front and center, how could this election possibly be like previous ones? Nonetheless, this election largely followed the same trends as previous years. Even with states in the Midwest and Georgia flipping Blue compared to 2016, we can hardly say these were shocking surprises. We knew that Democrat support in key cities and suburbs was growing, while Republican strongholds in rural areas continued to dominate.

But when we look at the county-level data, we do see some surprises.

#### Miami-Dade County, Florida

Perhaps the most popularized by the media was Miami-Dade County in Florida. In the past, this county has been increasingly Democratic, and Hillary Clinton handily won the county by 29 points. However, this was not the case in 2020. Biden was able to narrowly beat Trump by 7 points, a 22 point swing towards Trump since 2016. 

We can see the increasingly Democratic trend, and the sharp drop towards Trump in 2020 below:

Many speculations attribute this to the Trump campaign's rhetoric on the Democratic Party's move towards socialism in America, a move which helped to sway many Cuban-Americans who had fled Communist Cuba towards the Republican Party. 

#### Lake County, California

Less noted in the media, Lake County California shifted heavily Democratic. Since Obama's election, the county has been becoming more Republican (though they still voted Democratic). However, in 2020 there was a stark contrast to its recent elections, and instead turned heavily in favor of Biden.

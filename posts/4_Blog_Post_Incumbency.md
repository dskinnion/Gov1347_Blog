# Incumbency

## October 3, 2020

<br>

### Background

**While there is evidence to suggest that voters don't select an incumbent just because they are an incumbent, there are various theories that suggest the institutional advantages that an incumbent President has can affect voters' preferences.**

In a randomized study by [Adam Brown](https://hollis.harvard.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=TN_cdi_proquest_journals_1680832786&context=PC&vid=HVD2&search_scope=everything&tab=everything&lang=en_US), it is shown that at the ballot, having "*incumbent*" next to a candidate's name does not increase their vote share. In this way, voters do not care about incumbency *qua* incumbency (i.e. just the state of being an incumbent does not sway voters). However, this study does not investigate certain advantages from which incumbents benefit.

Some of these advantages include, but are not limited to:
* **Media Attention**: Incumbents have the added benefit of increased media attention throughout their presidency, as compared to challenger's media attention primarily during the election cycle.
* **Fundraising Time**: Incumbents can start fundraising the minute they are elected. Challengers on the other hand, do not typically even decide to run for the presidency until about two years before the election.
* **No Primary**: Incumbents are typically not challenged by a member of their own party. This means that they don't have to spend money against same-party rivals like challengers do, and they can rally the support of their entire party, whereas challengers must compete against rival factions within their party.
* **Economic Manipulation**: There is evidence to suggest that incumbents may manipulate the economy to ensure their victory by moving economic gains to election cycles [(Achen and Bartels)](https://muse-jhu-edu.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/chapter/2341029). Incumbents may also allocate funds to competitive states during elections years, in order to possibly influence votes in key states [(Kriner and Reeves)](https://hollis.harvard.edu/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=TN_cdi_proquest_miscellaneous_1030887189&context=PC&vid=HVD2&search_scope=everything&tab=everything&lang=en_US).

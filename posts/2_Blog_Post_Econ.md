### Background

The idea that voters use past information to inform their voting decisions is known as the **retrospective theory**. As posited in [*Democracy for Realists*](https://muse-jhu-edu.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/chapter/2341025) by Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, voters may use economic information to inform their voting decisions. The idea is nothing new; leaders have known for centuries that the economy is a pressing matter to citizens. [Achen and Bartels](https://muse-jhu-edu.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/chapter/2341029) introduced their model to explain the incumbent party's popular vote margin by using the *Q14-Q15* (14th Quarter and 15th Quarter of the President's term) growth in *real disposable income* per capita (average amount of income a person takes home after taxes), because this statistic usually accounts for many other economic factors, such as inflation, taxes, and unemployment.

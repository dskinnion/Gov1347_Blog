### Background

The idea that voters use past information to inform their voting decisions is known as the **retrospective theory**. As posited in [*Democracy for Realists*](https://muse-jhu-edu.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/chapter/2341025) by Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels, voters may use economic information to inform their voting decisions. The idea is nothing new; leaders have known for centuries that the economy is a pressing matter to citizens. [Achen and Bartels](https://muse-jhu-edu.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/chapter/2341029) introduced their model to explain the incumbent party's popular vote margin by using the *Q14-Q15* (14th Quarter - 15th Quarter of the President's term) growth in *real disposable income* per capita (average amount of income a person takes home after taxes), because this statistic usually accounts for many other economic factors, such as *inflation*, *taxes*, and *unemployment*. There is significant evidence to suggest that these short-term growths late in the Presidential term have a positive impact on the incumbent party's margin of the popular vote. 

### Economic Factors

Here I've focused on national economic statistics. Due to the research by [Achen and Bartels](https://muse-jhu-edu.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/chapter/2341029), I've selected 2nd Quarter Growth in *GDP* (Gross Domestic Product -- the total value of goods and services in the time period) and *RDI* (Read Disposable Income). The research suggests that voters TODO TODO TODO TODO

### Q2 GDP Growth Model:

In this model, we predict the incumbent party's two party vote share from the 2nd Quarter GDP Growth during the election year.

### Q2 RDI Growth Model:

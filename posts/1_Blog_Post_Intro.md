# Introduction: Past Elections

## September 11, 2020

### Election History

It is important for us to look at historical trends in order to better inform ourselves on current and future trends. For this reason, this introductory blog post will focus exclusively on past elections. Rather than trying to predict the 2020 election with models, this week, I will simply look at trends from past elections. Specifically, I will look at states which have recently become swing states.

### Swing States

For the purposes of this post, "vote swing," or simply "swing," refers to the difference in a state's voting proportions from election to election. Here, we will focus on each state's Democratic swing (i.e. the difference in the state's proportion of votes that go to the Democratic Candidate in the Presidential Election from the last election to this election). In this way, **"Swing State" will refer to a state that has experienced a large swing in favor of either the Democratic or Republican Candidate**. This is different from the other definition of a "Swing State" where we look at how close the election seems. Mathematically, this can be calculated as:

(D<sub>y</sub> / (D<sub>y</sub>+R<sub>y</sub>)) - (D<sub>y-4</sub> / (D<sub>y-4</sub>+R<sub>y-4</sub>))

where D<sub>y</sub> and R<sub>y</sub> are the number of votes for the Democratic Candidate and Republican Candidate in the current election, and D<sub>y-4</sub> and R<sub>y-4</sub> are the number of votes for the Democratic Candidate and Republican Candidate in the prior election. **Note that a positive value means that the state has swung more Democratic, and a negative value means that the state has swung more Republican**.

#### 2016 Election Swing

The more blue that a state is, the more that their votes swung in favor of the Democratic Candidate in 2016 compared to 2012. The more red that a state is, the more that their votes swung in favor of the Republican Candidate in 2016 compared to 2012. *This does not mean that the state voted the way that it swung*, but rather that *the state's proportion of votes has shifted more that way*. For example, from 2012 to 2016, we can see that Utah swung more Democratic, but it still voted Republican, and that New York swung more Republican, but it still voted Democratic. 

States that swung the most from 2012 to 2016:

* **Utah** with a swing of 0.122 (*+D*). In what is usually a Republican stronghold, Trump won with much less support than Romney had earned from the state in 2012. In 2016, [Time](https://time.com/4397192/donald-trump-utah-gary-johnson/) speculated that Utah's Mormon values kept many Republicans from voting for Trump.
* **North Dakota** with a swing of -0.097 (*+R*)
* **West Virginia** with a swing of -0.0849 (*+R*)
* **Iowa** with a swing of -0.0802 (*+R*)
* **South Dakota** with a swing of -0.675 (*+R*)
* **Maine** with a swing of -0.0626 (*+R*)
* **Ohio** with a swing of -0.0578 (*+R*). Just one of many Midwest states that Clinton was unable to win, [Real Clear Politics](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2017/01/19/how_trump_won_the_midwest_132834.html) says that Democratic support in rural Midwestern areas dropped significantly from 2012 to 2016.
* **Rhode Island** with a swing of -0.0571 (*+R*)
* **Missouri** with a swing of -0.0504 (*+R*)
* **Michigan** with a swing of -0.0492 (*+R*). In what was one of the closer states in 2016, [Politico](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/michigan-hillary-clinton-trump-232547) blames poor Democratic campaign management, among many other factors, for Michigan's swing towards Trump.

It is interesting to note that only one of these ten states swung more Democratic. This tells us that 1) Trump did a much better job of swinging voters who had voted for Obama and retaining voters who had voted for Romney; and 2) Clinton did a poor job of swinging voters who had voted for Romney and retaining voters who had voted for Obama.

# Introduction: Past Elections

### Election History

It is important for us to look at historical trends in order to better inform ourselves on current and future trends. For this reason, this introductory blog post will focus exclusively on past elections. Rather than trying to predict the 2020 election with models, this week, I will simply look at trends from past elections. Specifically, I will look at states which have recently become swing states.

### Swing States

For the purposes of this post, "vote swing," or simply "swing," refers to the difference in a state's voting proportions from election to election. Here, we will focus on each state's Democratic swing (i.e. the difference in the state's proportion of votes that go to the Democratic Candidate in the Presidential Election from the last election to this election). In this way, **"Swing State" will refer to a state that has experienced a large swing in favor of either the Democratic or Republican Candidate**. This is different from the other definition of a "Swing State" where we look at how close the election seems. Mathematically, this can be calculated as:

(D<sub>y</sub> / (D<sub>y</sub>+R<sub>y</sub>)) - (D<sub>y-4</sub> / (D<sub>y-4</sub>+R<sub>y-4</sub>))

where D<sub>y</sub> and R<sub>y</sub> are the number of votes for the Democratic Candidate and Republican Candidate in the current election, and D<sub>y-4</sub> and R<sub>y-4</sub> are the number of votes for the Democratic Candidate and Republican Candidate in the prior election. **Note that a positive value means that the state has swung more Democratic, and a negative value means that the state has swung more Republican**. 

#### 2016 Election Swing Map

The more blue that a state is, the more that their votes swung in favor of the Democratic Candidate in 2016 compared to 2012. The more red that a state is, the more that their votes swung in favor of the Republican Candidate in 2016 compared to 2012. *This does not mean that the state voted the way that it swung*, but rather that *the state's proportion of votes has shifted more that way*. For example, from 2012 to 2016, we can see that Utah swung more Democratic, but it still voted Republican, and that New York swung more Republican, but it still voted Democratic.

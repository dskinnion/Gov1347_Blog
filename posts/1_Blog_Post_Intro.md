### Election History

It is important for us to look at historical trends in order to inform us on current and future trends. For this reason, this introductory blog post will focus exclusively on past elections. Rather than trying to predict the 2020 election with models, this week, I will simply look at trends from past elections. Specifically, I will look at states which have recently become swing states.

### Swing States

For the purposes of this post, "swing" refers to the difference in a state's voting proportions from election to election. Here, we will focus on each state's Democratic swing (i.e. the difference in the state's proportion of votes that go to the Democratic Candidate in the Presidential Election from the last election to this election). Note that a positive value means that the state has swung more Democratic, and a negative value means that the state has swung more Republican. Mathematically, this can be calculated as:

(D<sub>y</sub> / (D<sub>y</sub>+R<sub>y</sub>)) - (D<sub>y-4</sub> / (D<sub>y-4</sub>+R<sub>y-4</sub>))

where D<sub>y</sub> and R<sub>y</sub> are the number of votes for the Democratic Candidate and Republican Candidate in the current election, and D<sub>y-4</sub> and R<sub>y-4</sub> are the number of votes for the Democratic Candidate and Republican Candidate in the prior election.

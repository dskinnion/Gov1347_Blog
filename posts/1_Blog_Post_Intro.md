### Swing States

For the purposes of this post, "swing" refers to the difference in a state's voting proportions from year to year. Mathematically, this is calculated as:

(D<sub>y</sub> / (D<sub>y</sub>+R<sub>y</sub>)) - (D<sub>y-4</sub> / (D<sub>y-4</sub>+R<sub>y-4</sub>))

where D<sub>y</sub> and R<sub>y</sub> are the number of votes for the Democratic Candidate and Republican Candidate in the current election, and D<sub>y-4</sub> and R<sub>y-4</sub> are the number of votes for the Democratic Candidate and Republican Candidate in the prior election.

# Dominic Skinnion's Election Analysis Blog

Welcome to my blog! I will be updating this blog weekly on Fridays. I am a student in Harvard's Election Analytics (GOV 1347) Fall 2020 course taught by Professor Ryan Enos.

This blog is aimed at describing election trends and predicting the 2020 Presidential Election.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, comments, recommendations, etc.! I can be reached at [dskinnion@college.harvard.edu](mailto:dskinnion@college.harvard.edu).
